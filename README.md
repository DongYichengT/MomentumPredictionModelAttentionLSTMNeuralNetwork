# Predicting-the-future-Game-momentum-prediction-model-based-on-attention-LSTM-neural-network
Construct a 5-layer LSTM-Attention neural network model based on the attention mechanism, which is used to predict the momentum changes in tennis matches in real time. And achieved good generalization performance in boxing and basketball competitions.
